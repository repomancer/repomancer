# Design Notes

- Use `gh` as the interface to GitHub because:
    - It's already good at handling edge cases like different repository URLs
    - Will return JSON
    - Handles Authentication and credential storage well

- Where to put code:
    - Custom widgets hold layout
    - Windows hold logic that wires things together (sets callbacks, etc.)
    - Project struct holds project state, can be loaded/saved
